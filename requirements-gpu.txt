# Optional GPU libraries for enhanced validation
# Install with: pip install -r requirements-gpu.txt

# NVIDIA GPU monitoring (works on most systems)
pynvml>=11.4.1

# OpenCL support for AMD/Intel/Apple GPUs (requires OpenCL drivers)
pyopencl>=2023.1

# CUDA support for NVIDIA compute (choose based on your CUDA version)
cupy-cuda12x>=12.0.0  # For CUDA 12.x systems
# cupy-cuda11x>=11.0.0  # For CUDA 11.x systems (uncomment if using CUDA 11.x)

# Note: These libraries have system requirements:
# - pynvml: Works anywhere, only monitors NVIDIA GPUs
# - pyopencl: Requires OpenCL drivers (nvidia-opencl-dev, amd-opencl-dev, etc.)
# - cupy: Requires NVIDIA CUDA toolkit (https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads)
