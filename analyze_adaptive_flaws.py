The BIGGEST remaining flaw is:
üî¥ SNAPSHOT SYNCHRONIZATION

Problem: Validators only snapshot when THEY run at interval blocks
Solution needed: Validators must query metagraph AT SPECIFIC BLOCKS

Current: if validator.runs() and block % 720 == 0: snapshot()
Needed: for block in [720, 1440, 2160, ...]: snapshot(query_metagraph_at(block))

This requires: Historical blockchain queries (not currently possible)
