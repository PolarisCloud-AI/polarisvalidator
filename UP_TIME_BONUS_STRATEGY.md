# 🏅 Uptime Bonus Strategy for Polaris Validator

## 📊 Current System Analysis

### **Existing Uptime Infrastructure**
- ✅ **Uptime Calculation**: `calculate_uptime()` and `calculate_historical_uptime()`
- ✅ **Uptime Logging**: JSON logs with timestamp, status, compute_score, block_number
- ✅ **Payment Tracking**: Separate payment logs with reward_amount, blocks_active
- ✅ **Current Bonuses**: Basic uptime bonuses (5%, 10%, 15% based on 70%, 85%, 95% thresholds)

### **Current Reward Flow**
1. **Compute Rewards**: Based on PoW, container count, resource quality
2. **Uptime Rewards**: Separate calculation based on blocks_active and uptime
3. **Aggregation**: `aggregate_rewards()` combines compute + uptime rewards
4. **Alpha Penalties**: Applied after aggregation

## 🔧 Implementation Strategy

### **Phase 1: Enhanced Uptime Tracking**

#### **1.1 Extended Uptime Metrics**
```python
def calculate_enhanced_uptime_metrics(miner_uid: str, current_block: int) -> Dict:
    return {
        'current_uptime': calculate_uptime(miner_uid, current_block, 7200),
        'historical_uptime': calculate_historical_uptime(miner_uid, current_block, 14400),
        'consistency_score': calculate_consistency_score(miner_uid, current_block),
        'longevity_score': calculate_longevity_score(miner_uid, current_block),
        'reliability_factor': calculate_reliability_factor(miner_uid, current_block),
        'streak_count': calculate_consecutive_days(miner_uid, current_block),
        'recovery_score': calculate_recovery_score(miner_uid, current_block)
    }
```

#### **1.2 New Calculation Functions**
- `calculate_consistency_score()`: Measures uptime variance over time
- `calculate_longevity_score()`: Tracks total uptime duration
- `calculate_reliability_factor()`: Considers uptime stability
- `calculate_consecutive_days()`: Counts uninterrupted uptime days
- `calculate_recovery_score()`: Measures quick recovery from downtime

### **Phase 2: Bonus Application System**

#### **2.1 Uptime Bonus Calculator**
```python
def calculate_uptime_bonus(enhanced_metrics: Dict) -> Dict:
    return {
        'reliability_bonus': get_reliability_bonus(enhanced_metrics['current_uptime']),
        'consistency_bonus': get_consistency_bonus(enhanced_metrics['consistency_score']),
        'longevity_bonus': get_longevity_bonus(enhanced_metrics['longevity_score']),
        'special_bonuses': get_special_bonuses(enhanced_metrics),
        'total_bonus_multiplier': calculate_total_multiplier()
    }
```

#### **2.2 Integration Points**
- **Before Alpha Penalties**: Apply uptime bonuses to base scores
- **After Compute Rewards**: Enhance uptime rewards with bonuses
- **Separate Tracking**: Maintain uptime bonus history

### **Phase 3: Advanced Features**

#### **3.1 Predictive Bonuses**
- **Trend Analysis**: Bonus for improving uptime trends
- **Seasonal Patterns**: Recognition of seasonal reliability
- **Network Impact**: Bonus based on network contribution during critical periods
